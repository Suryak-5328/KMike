## **Encryption Mechanism**
    Encrypt all user files with AES-256-CBC.
    Random AES key and IV for each file.
    Encrypt AES keys with locally generated public key RSA-2048.
    Encrypt locally generated private key with RSA-2048 common public key.

## **Points to note**
* The details such as file_path and AES initialization vector are base64 encoded before being written to disk because I ran into some exceptions while trying to store them as they were.
* The encrypted local private key is being sent as a base64 encoded string because bytes are not JSON serializable.
* All the base64 encoded data will be bytes, so the conversion to ASCII needs to be done before getting them as strings. ASCII was chosen because the `b64decode()` functioncan handle ASCII strings by default.
* The `encrypted_file_path` key in the dictionary in `encrypt_files()` utf-8 encoding happens because b64encode accepts only byte objects.
* Some of the file encryption details are split into parts, encrypted and stored in a list when they are too large to be encrypted as a whole.
