## **Druid**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid is a functional, industrial grade ransomware targeting Windows systems that I have decided to create for learning about the inner workings of ransomware.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is written in Python, contrary to C or C++ which is supposed to be the languages for malware programming.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python was chosen because it was too much of a hassle to set up the C development environment in my Macbook and I have no intention of deploying the malware, so the performance and size do not matter.
