## **NAME NOT DECIDED**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The (name not decided yet) ransomware is a functional, industrial grade ransomware targeting Windows systems that I have decided to create for learning about the inner workings of ransomware.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is written in Python, contrary to C or C++ which is supposed to be the languages for malware programming.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python was chosen because it was too much of a hassle to set up the C development environment in my Macbook and I have no intention of deploying the malware, so the performance and size do not matter.   


## **Getting Started**

## **Feature List:**
 * ~~Encrypt, Decrypt Files~~  
 * ~~Delete Original Files~~  
 * Show ransom message  
 * Auto Payment Verification  
 * The ransom note should persist across restarts  
 * Make the python code into an executable
 * Privilege escalation  
 * Communicate via Tor  
 * Sandbox Evasion  
 * AV Evasion  
 * Obfuscate Code  
 * Multithreading/multiprocessing to speed up encryption  
 * [`Shutdown some processes before encrypting files to ensure no write lock is present`](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/103030/malware/sodinokibi-ransomware-new-feature.html)

   This blog post helped me with deciding the encryption scheme used and the accompanying repo helped me with solving the problem of encrypting the locally generated RSA public key
