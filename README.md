## **Krombopulos Michael (KMike)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KMike is a ransomware that I decided to create for learning about the inner workings of ransomware.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is written in Python, contrary to C or C++ which are supposed to be the languages for malware programming.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python was chosen because it was too much of a hassle to set up the C development environment in my Macbook and I have no intention of deploying the malware, so the performance and size do not matter. The ransomware design intentionally includes some choices to deter people from using it for nefarious purposes.
